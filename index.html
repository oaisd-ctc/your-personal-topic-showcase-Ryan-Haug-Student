            <p>Terraria is a 2d progression/sandbox game. There are a vast number of different ways to play the game with 4 classes over 20 unique bosses and a huge modding community.
                The main focuses of terraria include, building, exploring, mining, crafting, and most importantly combat. The game offers Player vs Entity combat, like bosses, or just regular mobs, but there is also a 
                Player Vs Player option included with multiplayer. Terraria has been around for over a decade and had consistently recieved updates and still has the final one in progress (however its final update number 6).
                For 10$, also often on sale for less, Terraria is one of my favorite games and I have put over 300hours into the base game alone, not including mods. If you have free time deffinetly check it out and keep reading more about it on my page.
