                    <p id="gamedisc">Terraria is a 2d survival/sandbox game, the game has a very heavy focus on progression which is
                    acheived through exploring, mining, crafting, and combat to name a few. Terraria features both
                    single and multiplayer options to play with up to 3 of your friends, but that limit can be changed
                    via the very active modding community. Terraria is nearing the end of developement after 13 years
                    and 6 "final" updates, but who knows if thats truely the end.
