            <li>Melee - <br>
                <p class="listp">The melee class is a fairly easy class, using swords with high defense armor. although its a close range  class most endgame weapons fire projectiles which make it like a mage and ranger combination.
                    Sub classes include, true melee, which involves using melee damaging weapons with no extra projectiles fired, probably one of the most difficult ways to beat the game.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Ranger -
                <p class="listp">A medium defense class with ranged weapons, In my opinion its the most fun class to play and one of the easier ones. weapons have a fairly linear progression throughout the game with multiple different types of weapons.
                    Some sub classes are Bows only, shotguns only, there are way more due to sheer variety of weapons.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Mage -
                <p class="listp">magik, ooOOOOOoOoO<br>
                    there is a couple sub classes for mage, including spell tombs, staves, or other misc weapons. Mage is almost like a glass cannon, they have a ton of attack power but very little defense and a huge variety of weapons.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Summoner -
                <p class="listp">A very unique class compared to the others, you dont get much defense but at the same time you have aimbot built in because you dont controll the attacks, your minions attack for you. Summoner is a nice class where you dont actually have to play the game, just sit back and watch.
                    there is one subclass to summoner and that is sentrys, while not directly referred to as a subclass people have beat the game using only sentrys, all sentrys are is just a stationary minion.
